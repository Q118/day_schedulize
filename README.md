# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Schedulize



## Description 
    Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 
    This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Objectives
    GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

    WHEN I open the planner
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

    WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

    WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
    THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

    WHEN I click into a timeblock
    THEN I can enter an event

    WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

    WHEN I refresh the page
    THEN the saved events persist
